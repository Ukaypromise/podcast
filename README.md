## Introduction

Podcast is a web application designed to showcase and manage podcast content. It provides a user-friendly interface for both podcast creators and listeners. With features like user registration, podcast creation, episode uploads, and more, Podcast makes it easy to manage and enjoy podcast content.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Ruby**: The project uses Ruby, and you should have it installed. You can check your Ruby version by running `ruby -v`.

- **Rails**: Podcast is built on the Ruby on Rails framework. You should have Rails installed. You can check your Rails version by running `rails -v`.

- **Node.js and npm**: The front-end of the application is built using React, so you'll need Node.js and npm. You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v`.

- **Database**: Ensure you have a working relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) installed and configured.

- **Git**: You will need Git for version control. You can check if Git is installed by running `git --version`.

## Installation

To install Podcast, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/podcast.git
   cd podcast
   ```

2. Install Ruby and Rails dependencies:
   ```sh
   bundle install
   ```

3. Install Node.js and React dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

For the project to function correctly, you need to configure some settings. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a `config/application.yml` file to store your application-specific configurations, such as API keys, environment variables, and secrets.

2. Configure your database settings in `config/database.yml` to connect to your chosen database.

3. You may need to configure other environment-specific settings in `config/environments`.

## Database Setup

To create and initialize the database, run the following commands:

```sh
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed # If you have seed data
```

## Running the Application

To start the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the Rails server:
   ```sh
   rails s
   ```

2. Start the React front-end:
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Testing

Podcast includes a test suite for both the back-end and front-end. Run the tests with the following commands:

- Back-end (Rails):
  ```sh
  rails test
  ```

- Front-end (React):
  ```sh
  cd client
  npm test
  ```
